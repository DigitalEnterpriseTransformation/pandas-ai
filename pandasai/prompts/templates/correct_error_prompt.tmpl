### The user asked the following question:
{{context.memory.get_conversation()}}

### You generated this python code:

### Task description Reminder
Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: {% include 'shared/output_type_template.tmpl' with context %}

2. At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.
{% if context.config.data_viz_library %}
3. If you are asked to plot a chart, use "{{context.config.data_viz_library}}" for charts, save as png.
{% endif %}
### Your turn
Fix the python code above and return the new python code:
